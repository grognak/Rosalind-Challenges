ROSALIND Reversal Distance (REAR)

Problem
A reversal of a permutation creates a new permutation by inverting some interval of the 
permutation; (5,2,3,1,4), (5,3,4,1,2), and (4,1,2,3,5) are all reversals of (5,3,2,1,4).
The reversal distance between two permutations π and σ, written drev(π,σ), is the 
minimum number of reversals required to transform π into σ (this assumes that π and σ
have the same length).

Given: A collection of at most 5 pairs of permutations, all of which have length 10.

Return: The reversal distance between each permutation pair.
